Pocket Change is an Android app that allows users to come to a decision on what to do before they meet up. 

### Features:
1. **Multiple Group Spaces:** Each user can be a part of multiple different groups depending on the different people they hang out with.
2. **Bucket Lists:** Each group has their own bucket lists that they can add to whenever they come up with an idea.
3. **Custom Event Additions:** Users can add custom events that specify different fields such as:
	(a) price ranges they're comfortable with,
	(b) categories that the event falls under,
	(c) expire dates for events that are only temporarily available.
4. **Anonymous Voting:** Users can specify what price ranges and categories they feel comfortable with doing on the day they plan to meet up. They can also choose specific events from the bucket list.
5. **Data Displays:** When anonymous voting ends, all users can see what the distribution of choices from the rest of the group. The app will also display bucket list choices that align with all the members' preferences.
6. **Final Selections:** After viewing the data, each group member can select a choice, and the app will display the most commonly selected choice for everyone.
